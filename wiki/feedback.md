Needed an admin to manage the survey tasks and users: The client requested the implementation of an administrative role in the system. This role would be responsible for managing survey-related tasks, such as creating, editing, or deleting surveys, as well as managing user accounts. The admin should have oversight and control over user permissions, ensuring smooth operations and proper handling of survey data.

Document the SQL setup and changes in a document: The client emphasized the importance of documenting all configurations and modifications made to the SQL database. This includes writing down details about the database schema, any queries, updates, or structural changes, and explaining why these changes were made. This document will serve as a reference for future developers or administrators who might work with the system.

Include all the documents in the handover directory: The client requested that all related documentation, such as user guides, technical manuals, and the SQL documentation, be collected and organized in a single, easily accessible handover directory. This ensures that anyone who takes over the project can quickly find the necessary files and resources to understand and manage the system.
