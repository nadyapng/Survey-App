## Item 1 - General comments
- Tutor next week will prepare some slides to show us exactly the individual report and feedback from all of our reports
    - Will give us a plan on how to actually write the individual report (what details they're looking for, how they're gonna separate students)
    - Write as many details for claims as possible
    - Tutor recommendation: spend some time every week to write down everything you did each week (all message sent, all collaboration, all evidence, all feedback given to others, all feedback given to you)
