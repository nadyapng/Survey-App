## Item 1 - What is in progress?
- Tuning Gemini
- Gemini survey question generation
- Qualtrics API testing for survey creation

## Item 2 - Updates
- Updated the professor on issues we’re having in Qualtrics
- Our gemini question generation works, but the Qualtrics Api has a lot of issues with formatting


## Item 2 - General Comments and questions

Demo video stuff
- Have some designs of the web app interface
- Frontend, backend design (I’m guessing he means system architecture?)
- User management functions
- Try show some question generation stuff, survey creation is optional

Interface questions:
- How many functions do you want in the navigation bar?
    - Add some functions such as: about, contact, view created surveys
- Should be able to edit questions, but also allowed to delete question, add new custom question

- Maybe add templates in the future that can be used to generate survey questions
- Website doesn’t need to look great right now, interface can be left for later
