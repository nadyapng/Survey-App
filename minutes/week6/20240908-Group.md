The meeting began with a discussion of several key aspects of the project, including the status of the backend API build, specifically the integration of Qualtrics and Gemini. The team confirmed that the user authentication system had been successfully implemented and that the user registration and login functions were working properly. The database setup was also completed successfully, and the part using MySQL for data storage is progressing well.
