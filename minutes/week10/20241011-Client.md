## Item 1 - Updates
- Data visualization is complete; users can now view charts and diagrams for survey results.
- No need for complex analysis; simple visual representations are sufficient.
- Survey publishing is almost complete, with only minor issues in Qualtrics remaining.
- Focus is now shifting to documentation.
- If time permits, we may explore importing existing Qualtrics surveys into our platform.

## Item 2 - Next steps
- We will be revising the UI; the current interface needs improvement.
    - Specifically, the first page can be made more visually appealing.
- The data CSV should be in Qualtrics CSV format (this should already be done, as we are pulling CSV files directly from Qualtrics).

## Item 3 - Final demo preparation
- Plan for the final demo:
    - Show the client a full demonstration of the software, including all functionalities and usage from scratch.
    - Ensure that the client is aware of which branch contains the latest version of the complete software.
    - Upload all project content to Bitbucket, including documentation.
    - We will invite the client to join our Bitbucket repository.
    - Provide detailed instructions on how to run the application, including required packages and a step-by-step guide.
    - Investigate the feasibility of including the import survey function.
